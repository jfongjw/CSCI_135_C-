/*
Because numbers are represented in the computer with a limited number of digits, they cannot represent arbitrary integer or floating-point numbers.

The int type has a limited range: On most platforms, it can represent numbers up to a little more than two billion. For many applications, this is not a problem, but you cannot use an int to represent the world population.

If a computation yields a value that is outside the int range, the result overflows. No error is displayed. Instead, the result is truncated to fit into an int, yielding a useless value. For example,

int one_billion = 1000000000;

cout << 3 * one_billion << endl;

displays â€“1294967296.

In situations such as this, you can switch to double values.
